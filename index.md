## Project Title
Disease Detection and Identification in Cotton Leaves.

## Team Description (Group-23)
- Team Name: Stupid stuff no one needs and other terrible ideas

1) Neel Puniwala - Complete geek. He likes to solve problems and when there are none available, he creates his own.

2) Parth Satodiya - He is mostly wrong, but since it is computer science, he is just off by a bit.

3) Charvik Patel - To understand this guy, you need to first understand this guy.

4) Kishan Khakhar - Hates OOP. He has no class.

5) Jainil Vachhani - This guy writes no bug, just undocumented features.


## Project Abstract
- The primary purpose of the project is to identify whether a particular cotton leaf is diseased or not and if it is
diseased, identification of the disease is done. We have considered three main diseases - Alternaria Macrospora, Bacterial Blight and Grey Mildew. We are using Multi-SVM classification algorithm, to identify among different classes. The training data
are images taken from web which are uploaded by ordinary humans. Assuming that the images are taken in uncontrolled environment, many difficulties are faced, making the machine-learning algorithm less effective. Therefore, some pre-processing like clustering, segmentation is done to improve the quality of learning. We have used various statistical features (mean,
Standard deviation, variance etc.) as training features for our algorithm.

## Connection with the theme "Agriculture"
- India's is the highest producer of Cotton. Every year 20 to 25% of cotton crops fails due to disease which results into a
very huge amount of diseased crops. The common diseases observed in cottoon leafs which we have considered for our project are bacterial Blight, Grey Mildew and Alternaria Macrosopra. These diseases in cotton leaf are very much prevalent in gujarat.Pre-detection of these diseases by use of Machine Learning Techniques can significantly help the farmers to prevent the disease from causing more damage to the crop. This could substantially reduce the damage to crop.
  
## Methodology
- Talking about the methods to detect disease and identify it :
 There are many ways to extract the diseased part from a leaf image like extracting color,shape,texture etc...
 We have used Mutli-SVM for classification of diseases and k-means clustering for image segmentation.
